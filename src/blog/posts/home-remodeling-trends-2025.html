        <p>The demand for versatile spaces continues to grow as homeowners seek to maximize every square foot of their homes. Rooms that serve multiple purposes are no longer just a luxury—they're becoming essential.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Home Offices:</strong> Dedicated workspaces with built-in storage and soundproofing</li>
            <li><strong>Guest Room Conversions:</strong> Spaces that function as offices, gyms, or hobby rooms with Murphy beds</li>
            <li><strong>Kitchen Islands:</strong> Extended to include dining areas and homework stations</li>

        <h2>2. Natural and Sustainable Materials</h2>
        <p>Eco-conscious design is taking center stage, with homeowners increasingly choosing materials that are both beautiful and environmentally responsible.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reclaimed Wood:</strong> For accent walls, flooring, and custom furniture</li>
            <li><strong>Natural Stone:</strong> Locally sourced materials for countertops and backsplashes</li>
            <li><strong>Bamboo Flooring:</strong> Sustainable and durable alternative to hardwood</li>
            <li><strong>Low-VOC Paints:</strong> Healthier indoor air quality without sacrificing color</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> Look for materials with third-party certifications like FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) or Greenguard to ensure sustainability.</div>

        <h2>3. Smart Home Integration</h2>
        <p>Technology continues to seamlessly blend into home design, making everyday living more convenient and efficient.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Integrated Lighting:</strong> Voice-controlled and programmable LED systems</li>
            <li><strong>Smart Thermostats:</strong> Zone-controlled heating and cooling for comfort and efficiency</li>
            <li><strong>Automated Shades:</strong> Privacy and light control at your fingertips</li>

            <li><strong>Open Shelving:</strong> Display spaces for dishes and decorative items</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> If bold colors feel too permanent, incorporate them through backsplashes, hardware, or light fixtures that are easier to change later.</div>

        </ul>
        <div class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> Invest in quality fixtures and materials for bathrooms—they're heavily used spaces where durability matters as much as aesthetics.</div>
